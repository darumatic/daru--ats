# Candidates

## What This Module Is For
Candidates stores profile, status, ownership, resume, skills, education, work history, notes, files, and related hiring activity.

It also includes an on-demand AI summary modal, opened from the candidate detail header, that turns the current candidate profile into a concise recruiter-facing brief.

Candidate detail now opens with a stronger candidate snapshot card that surfaces title, location, status, top skills, AI summary snippet, last activity, and profile completeness in one recruiter-friendly block.

The snapshot card also surfaces a timeline-based `Suggested Next Step` so recruiters can see the most likely next action, such as reviewing the resume, submitting to a job order, scheduling an interview, or following up on an offer.

Candidate detail also includes a unified `Timeline` workspace tab so recruiters can review notes, activities, file uploads, status changes, submissions, interviews, placements, and AI-summary events in one chronological feed.

The candidates list also supports a separate `Advanced Search` builder so recruiters can combine structured filters like owner, source, skills, resume keywords, profile-completeness score, submission counts, and last-activity dates without overloading the basic search box.

Candidate names in table/list contexts are shown as `Last, First` so alphabetic sorting is more useful across candidate-linked lists.

## Required Fields
On create, required fields are enforced with red `*` markers and disabled Save until valid.

Common required fields include:
- Name
- Email
- Mobile phone
- Status
- Source
- Owner
- Current employer
- Current job title

## Resume Intake Options

### Manual Entry
Use when profile data is known and no resume parsing is needed.

### Resume Parse
Use upload or paste mode. The system attempts AI parsing when configured, and falls back to built-in parsing if AI is unavailable.

What parsing can populate:
- Identity/contact fields
- Skills
- Resume summary text
- Education rows
- Work experience rows
- Parsed resume files and career-site resume uploads are labeled as `Resume` automatically when attached to the candidate.
- Files in the candidate workspace can also be manually marked or unmarked as the candidate's `Resume`.

## Skills Management
- Skills are selected from admin-maintained options.
- Unknown skills can be captured in the "Other" area.
- Chips are removable inline.

## Candidate Workspace
The workspace provides linked execution views:
- Submissions
- Interviews
- Placements
- Notes
- Activities
- Files
- Matched Job Orders
- Timeline

## Profile Completeness
Candidate detail calculates profile completeness from the live record and current form values.

It looks at:
- core identity/contact fields
- status, source, and owner
- current role and location
- links
- resume summary
- skills
- work history
- education
- primary resume attachment
- required custom fields

The score is intended as a recruiter readiness signal, not a hard validation rule.

The candidate snapshot card also calls out the top missing profile gaps so users know what to fix next.

The candidates list also shows a compact profile-completeness chip so recruiters can spot weak records before opening detail.

The same score can also be used as an advanced-search filter on the candidates list.

The suggested-next-step card complements this score by turning current timeline and pipeline state into a recommended recruiter action.

When a recruiter tries to create a submission from a candidate with a thin profile, the app now shows a soft warning with the top missing gaps. The recruiter can still continue.

## AI Summary
Use the sparkles `AI Summary` header button on candidate detail to open the summary modal. If no summary exists yet, the modal starts generating one automatically from the current candidate record.

The generated summary includes:
- Overview
- Strengths
- Concerns
- Suggested next step

Behavior:
- Opening the modal auto-generates the first summary when none exists.
- Existing summaries can be refreshed from the modal.
- Requires an AI API key in `Admin Area > System Settings`.
- The summary is stored separately from the resume text.
- If no AI provider is configured, the AI controls remain visible but disabled with an inline hint.

## Match Explanations
The matched job orders workspace supports `Explain Match`.

What it does:
- Saves an AI explanation for the current candidate/job pair
- Explains:
	- why the role fits
	- likely gaps
	- what to validate
	- how to position the candidate honestly

Behavior:
- Generated on demand
- Saved and reusable for that candidate/job pair
- Can be refreshed when the candidate or job order changes
- If no AI provider is configured, `Explain Match` remains visible but disabled with a tooltip/hint.

## Actions Menu
From candidate detail, actions can launch:
- New submission
- New interview
- New placement
- Draft email
- Audit trail (administrators only)

## Email Drafting
Candidate detail actions include `Draft Email`.

What it does:
- Opens an AI drafting modal for the current candidate
- Lets the user choose:
	- purpose
	- tone
	- optional additional instructions
- Generates:
	- subject
	- body
- Supports copy to clipboard

Behavior:
- On demand only; drafts are not auto-saved to the record
- Requires an AI API key in `Admin Area > System Settings`
- If AI is unavailable, the action remains visible but disabled with a hint

## Duplicate Protection
Candidate creation includes duplicate checks and merge support when likely duplicates are detected.

## Best Practice
1. Parse resume if available.
2. Validate contact data and owner.
3. Confirm status and source.
4. Add at least one note with context.
5. Move into submission workflow quickly.
