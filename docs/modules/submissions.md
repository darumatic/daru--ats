# Submissions

## What This Module Is For
Submissions tracks candidate presentation to a specific job order.

The submissions list also supports a separate `Advanced Search` builder so recruiters can combine structured filters like status, origin, submitter, client-portal visibility, and submitted/updated date ranges without overloading the basic search box.

## Core Relationships
Each submission is linked to:
- One candidate
- One job order
- One client (via job order)
- One hiring manager (via job order/contact)

## Edit Constraints
After creation:
- Candidate and job order are locked
- Converted submissions become non-editable

## Common Lifecycle
1. Create submission.
2. Add recruiter notes/context.
3. Generate or edit a client-facing write-up.
4. Advance status through review/interview steps.
5. Convert to placement when accepted.

## Stages
Submission stages, in pipeline order: `Submitted`, `Under Review`, `Qualified`, `Offered`, `Hired`, `Placed`, `Rejected`. One shared list (`lib/submission-status.js`) drives the submission forms, the job-order pipeline board and the operational report.

- The stage can be changed from the submission form, or by dragging the card on the job order's `Pipeline Board` (see the Job Orders module), which calls the status-only `PATCH /api/submissions/{id}/status`. Both are audit-logged; neither asks for a reason.
- `Placed` is derived: a submission with an offer/placement always reads as `Placed` and is locked against edits and board moves. It is reached only through `Convert to Placement`, never by picking the status directly on the board.
- Stage changes on a submission never alter the candidate's overall status.

## Actions Menu
Key actions:
- Schedule interview
- Promote to / hide from client portal
- Open submission packet
- Convert to placement (with confirmation)
- View audit trail (administrators only)
- Archive

## Submission Packet
Submission detail includes a `Submission Packet` action for a print-friendly internal packet.

Behavior:
- Opens in a dedicated packet view from the submission actions menu
- Designed for browser print / Save as PDF
- Compiles:
	- recruiter write-up
	- primary resume download link
	- candidate snapshot
	- cached match explanation
	- recent interview activity and latest AI question set when available

## Client Write-Up
Submission detail includes a dedicated `Client Write-Up` field for polished recruiter/client-facing candidate summaries.

Behavior:
- Generate or refresh from the toolbar above the field
- Copy directly to the clipboard from the toolbar
- Output is stored on the submission record
- Recruiters can edit the generated text before saving
- Uses the OpenAI API key from `Admin Area > System Settings`
- If the submission is converted to a placement, the write-up remains visible but is locked
- If OpenAI is not configured, the generate control remains visible but disabled with an inline hint

## Client Feedback
Submission detail includes a `Client Feedback` section for portal-driven client responses.

Behavior:
- Submission detail shows both submission `Origin` and `Client Portal` visibility so recruiters can differentiate career-site responses from recruiter-curated submissions.
- Career-site `Web` responses start hidden from the client portal until a recruiter explicitly promotes them.
- Recruiters can later hide a submission from the client portal again from the same actions menu.
- Submission portal visibility controls and client feedback are hidden when the client portal is disabled globally.
- Shows comments, scorecard ratings, and action history submitted through the client review portal
- Includes the client name/email snapshot and timestamp for each entry
- Captures actions like `Request Interview`, `Feedback`, and `Pass`
- `Pass` is confirmed in the portal and locks the submission against any further client actions
- When a client uses `Pass`, the submission is also moved to the bottom of the job order's priority order
- The portal only exposes the candidate's labeled primary resume; other candidate attachments stay internal
- Feedback is read-only internally and serves as the client-side activity trail on the submission

## Workspace Timeline And Feedback
Submission detail also includes a unified workspace that brings `Timeline` and `Client Feedback` together in one place. The timeline shows submission creation, client write-up generation, client feedback, and placement conversion events in chronological order.

## Snapshot Usage
Snapshot emphasizes immutable context and links back to source records.

## Best Practice
- Always add concise submission notes so downstream users understand positioning.
- Keep status current to improve dashboard priority logic.

## Advanced Search
Use advanced search on the submissions list when quick lookup is not enough.

Useful examples:
- `Status = Submitted`
- `Origin = Web`
- `Client Portal = Hidden`
- `Submitted By = Alicia Morgan`
- `Submitted At in past 14 days`
